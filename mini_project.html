    <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
    <p>Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a mass surveillance system
        that captures the image of vehicles and recognizes their license number. This paper
        presents the implementation of ANPR in various places like malls, tolls etc. and it
        also presents a recognition method in which the vehicle plate image is obtained by
        a digital cameras and the image is processed to get the number plate information.</p>
    <p>The ANPR algorithm works on steps like extraction of numbers processing
        via filtering, segmentation, and character recognition. A data base is used to store
        the vehicle information. First the number plate is detected from an input frame,
        then the character from the plate are extracted and then OCR is applied to
        recognize the extracted character.</p>
    <p>After all the process, a data base is used to store the recognized vehicle
        number along with entry time and further exit time is also noted. Then using the
        entry time and the exit time, the parking fare is calculated, and a bill is generated
        using the Thermal printer.</p>

    <p>ANPR is an image processing innovation which is used to perceive vehicles
        by their tags. This expertise is ahead of time ubiquity in security and traffic
        installation. Tag Recognition system is an application of PC version. PC version is
        a technique for using a PC to take out abnormal state information from a digital
        image.</p>
    

    <p>The ANPR system consist of the following steps:</p>
    <p>· Vehicle image capture</p>
    <p>· Pre processing</p>
    <p>· Number Plate extraction</p>
    <p>· Character Segmentation</p>
    <p>· Character Recognition</p>
    

    <p>The ANPR system works in these strides,</p>
    <p>The initial step is the location of the vehicle and capturing a vehicle image of front
        or back perspective of the vehicle.</p>
    <p>The second step is the localization of the number plate and the extraction of
        vehicle number plate as an image.</p>
    <p>The final stride use image segmentation strategy, OCR (Optical Character
        Recognition) is one of the strategies to perceive each character with the assistance
        of database stored for separation alphanumeric character.</p>

    <h4>Literature Review:</h4>
    <p>Muhammad Tahir Qadri, In this anticipate for the recognition of OCR techniques
        is used which is susceptible to misalignment and to various sizes. A series of image
        processing techniques of the system for identifying the vehicle form the database
        stored in the PC.</p>
    <p>AmrBadr et al. In this paper Automatic Recognition of Car License Plate Number
        got to be indispensable part in our day by day life. This paper mainly explains an
        ANPR using Morphological operations, Histogram manipulation and Edge
        discovery techniques for plate localization and characters segmentation. Artificial
        Neural Networks are used for Character Classification and Recognitiion.</p>
    

    <h4>ANPR System Model:</h4>
    <p>Typical ANPR system consist of four steps these are Image Acquisition, License
        Plate Extraction, Character Segmentation, Character Recognition.</p>
    

    <h4>Image Acquisition:</h4>
    <p>The initial step is Acquisition of image. Getting an image using digital camera
        associated with the PC. Those caught images are in RGB format so it can be
        further processed for the Number Plate Extraction. The Database of the system
        contains the personal information of the vehicle proprietor and a few plate vehicle
        images, abbreviations and acronyms.</p>
    

    <h4>Image Processing:</h4>
    <p>Captured RGB image is influenced by many elements like Optical system
        distortion, system commotion, lack of presentation or over the top relative motion
        of camera or vehicle and so forth result is the degradation of a captured vehicle and
        the unfriendly influence of the further image processing. Pre-processing includes
        converting the RGB image into a gray scale image.</p>
    

    <h4>Plate Localization:</h4>
    <p>The basic stride is to recognise the plate size. By and large number plates are
        rectangular plate mat lab toolbox gives a function celled region props. It quantifies
        a set of properties for each marks region in the matrix. Will extricate from the
        input image.</p>
    

    <h4>Plate Segmentation:</h4>
    <p>It assumes an imperative role in ANPR. The essential thought after region
        growing is to remember one or more criteria that are quality for the wanted region.
        Subsequent to establishing the criteria, the image is looked for any pixels that
        satisfies the necessities. We get individual character and number images by using
        Vertical and Horizontal Scanning Techniques.</p>
    

    <h4>Character Recognition:</h4>
    <p>Distinctive strategies were used for character recognition, letters and characters
        in the paper. The character image is match up to our given database and the best
        resembling is considered. Another technique for character recognition is the OCR
        (Optical Character Recognition) is used to look at the very individual character
        against the complete alphanumeric database. The character is then contrasted and
        the database for the vehicle authorization.</p>

    <h4>MERITS AND DEMERITS OF THE BASE PAPER</h4>
    <h4>2.1 NUMBER PLATE DETECTION :</h4></br>
    <h4>2.1.1 EXISTING METHODOLOGIES :</h4>
    <h4>1: Image Binarization:</h4>
    <p>When compared to processing a grayscale image, black and white image
        processing requires less time. So there is a process called image binarization which
        converts a grayscale image into a black and white image. This technique selects a
        threshold to categorise certain pixels as black and certain pixels as white.
        However, how to select the right threshold value for a specific image is the key
        issue. Selecting the ideal threshold value can sometimes be exceedingly
        challenging or even impossible. To solve this issue, adaptive thresholding can be
        applied. A threshold can be manually chosen by the user or automatically chosen
        by an algorithm, which is referred to as automatic thresholding.</p>
    
    <h4>2: Hough Transform:</h4>
    <p>Hough Transform is a feature extraction technique that was initially employed for
        line detection. Later, it was later expanded to locate positions for arbitrary shapes
        like circles and ovals. D.H. Ballard generalised the original algorithm.</p>
    
    <h4>3: Blob Detection:</h4>
    <p>Blob detection is used to identify areas or points that stand out from their
        surroundings in terms of colour or brightness. The major goal of this method is to
        identify complementary regions that are not picked up by corner or edge detection
        techniques. Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), Difference of Gaussians (DoG),
        Determinant of Hessian (DoH), maximally stable extremal regions, and Principle
        curvature based region detector are a few popular blob detectors.</p>

    <h4>4: Connected Component Analysis (CCA):</h4>
    <p>It is also known as blob extraction, a method to specifically name connected
        components' subsets based on a specific heuristic. It scans a binary image and
        labels each pixel in accordance with the connection conditions of the
        corresponding pixel, such as the current pixel's (8-connectivity) north, east, north,
        north west, and west Only the current pixel's north and west neighbours employ 4-
        connectivity. For automated picture analysis, the algorithm performs better and is
        highly helpful. Both character and plate segmentation can be done using this
        technique.</p>

    <h4>5: Mathematical morphology:</h4>
    <p>Set theory, lattice theory, topology, and random functions serve as the foundation
        for mathematical morphology. Although it is frequently utilised with digital
        images, it can also be applied to other spatial structures. It was initially created for
        the purpose of processing binary images before being expanded to process
        grayscale functions and images. It has fundamental operators including erosion,
        dilation, opening, and closing.</p></br>

    <h4>2.1.2 PROPOSED METHODOLOGY:</h4>
    <h4>1: HAAR CASCADE ALGORITHM:</h4>
    <p>The Haar Cascade algorithm is a popular method for object detection in images,
        including the detection of license plates in images.
        The Haar Cascade algorithm is a kind of machine learning algorithm that trains a
        classifier using a set of positive and negative samples.
        Image which contain the required objects(license plate)are the positive samples,
        the image which doesn't contain the required object is the negative sample.</p>
    <p>
        The algorithm uses the Haar wavelet approach to extract features from the positive
        and negative data during training.
        Haar wavelets are mathematical functions that is capable of spotting changes in
        contrast in an image.
        The system can find features that are likely to be present on licence plates,
        including the edges and corners of characters, by examining the variations in
        contrast at various points in a picture.
        Once trained,it can detect the number plate in new images.</p>
    <p>The algorithm performs several scale and position scans of the image, computing a
        score at each point based on the existence of the features that were discovered
        during training.
        The algorithm assumes the area has a licence plate if the score is higher than a
        predetermined threshold.
        Overall, the Haar Cascade algorithm is a reliable and effective approach for
        detecting licence plates, and it has been applied to a variety of systems, including
        security systems and traffic monitoring.</p></br>
    

    <h4>STEPS INVOLVED TO DETECT LICENCE PLATE:</h4>
    <p>· Data Collection</p>
    <p>· Data Preparation</p>
    <p>· Feature Extraction</p>
    <p>· Training</p>
    <p>· Testing</p>
    <p>· Plate Detection</p></br>

    <h4>2.2 CHARACTER RECOGNITION:</h4>
    <h4>2.2.1 EXISTING METHODOLOGY:</h4>
    <h4>1. Artificial Neural Network(ANN):</h4>
    <p>Artificial Neural Network (ANN), also referred to as neural network, is a
        mathematical concept that refers to a system of artificial neurons that are
        connected to one another. Character classification is done using an ANN model. It
        has three layers: an input layer for decision-making, a hidden layer to calculate
        more complex associations, and an output layer for the choice that is decided. An
        ANN was trained using the feed-forward back-propagation (BP) algorithm. The
        authors assert that their recognition rate is greater than 99%.</p>
    <h4>2. Template Matching:</h4>
    <p>Recognising fixed-sized characters is made possible through template matching. It
        can also be utilised for object detection, generally face detection and medical
        image processing. It is further divided into two sections: template-based matching
        and feature-based matching. The feature-based technique is effective when the
        template image includes prominent elements; otherwise, the template-based
        approach can be helpful.</p></br>

    <h4>2.2.2 PROPOSED METHODOLOGY:</h4>
    <h4>1. OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION:</h4>
    <p>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a method used to identify characters or
        text in an image ( characters in license plate).
        To extract and recognise characters from images, OCR systems often combine
        image processing methods with machine learning algorithms.</p>

    <h4>· Character Recognition:</h4>
    <p>Apply the trained OCR algorithm to identify the characters from the new number
        plate image.
        The preprocessing of the image, character segmentation, feature extraction, and
        application of the OCR system to the extracted features are used to accomplish
        this.
        The character with the highest probability of being recognised is picked from a
        probability distribution over all potential characters that the OCR system outputs.</p>

    <h4>· Post-processing:</h4>
    <p>Refine the recognised characters using post-processing techniques, and get rid of
        any erroneous detections. Techniques like thresholding, morphological procedures,
        or language modelling can be used for this.</p>
    <p>Overall, OCR offers a strong and adaptable framework for licence plate character
        identification. The OCR system's correctness is influenced by the calibre and
        volume of the training data, the architecture used for the OCR system, and the
        potency of the pre- and post-processing methods.</p></br>

    <h3>MERITS :</h3>
    <p>· Automation: OCR algorithms are capable of automating the reading of
        license plate numbers, removing the need for manual data entry and
        minimizing errors.</p>
    <p>· Low computational demands: The Haar cascade approach is more suited for
        low-power devices and embedded systems since it uses less computing
        resources than other machine learning-based algorithms.</p>
    <p>· Integration: These algorithms are perfect for usage in automated systems
        because they are simple to integrate with other technologies like cameras,
        sensors, and databases.</p></br>

    <h3>DEMERITS:</h3>
    <p>· Limitations on language and font: OCR algorithms may have trouble reading
        characters from other languages or fonts, especially if those characters are
        underrepresented in the training data.</p>
    <p>· Limited adaptability: The Haar cascade method might not be able to
        accommodate modifications in license plate designs or variations in various
        regions or nations.</p></br>

    <h3>CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PLAN :</h3>
    <p>Thus, the number plate is recognized by using Image Processing. The
        information is stored in the database. The number plate image is obtained from the
        parking video footage of the digital cameras and then by using Haarcascade
        Algorithm and OCR technique the characters in the number plate are detected. The
        Entry time and Exit time of the vehicle is noted and then the fair is collected
        according to it. Hence manual work can be reduced by using this ANPR technique.</p>
    <p>In Future, this Automatic Number Plate Recognition can be developed by
        detecting the number plate from live videos. And better algorithm like YOLOv3
        shall be implemented for better accuracy.</p></br>
